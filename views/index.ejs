    <h3>SECURITY SYSTEM</h3>
    <p>
      Using raspberry pi, I designed a simple security system that gives user
      access if correct pin is inputed and a "valid key" message is displayed
      on the LCD, <br />
      After three tries and user fails, the buzzer beeps twice and an "Invalid
      Key-Try Again" message is displayed on the LCD
